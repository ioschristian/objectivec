# objectivec
My collection of Objective-C code and projects from the Bid Nerd Ranch Book and personal projects.

I have set out to finally learn Objective-C, since I see alot of job opportunities missed because I am not familiar with the language.  Therefore, I have created this repository to track the tutorials that I follow from Big Nerd Ranch, and also the personal projects that I create.

I currently work as a Junior iOS developer, and I believe that learning Objective-C will help me to level up as far as my skillset and career opportunities are concerned.

Thanks for reading!
